# FiveM Username Profanity Filter

This FiveM resource provides a plug-and-play solution for detecting and blocking profane strings in usernames. It seamlessly integrates with your FiveM server to ensure a clean and respectful gaming environment. The profanity detection functionality is powered by the library from [profanity.dev](https://github.com/joschan21/profanity.dev/).

## Installation

Its Plug and Play, just drag and drop the folder into your resources folder and add `start anti_profanity` to your server.cfg file.

## Usage

Once installed, the resource will automatically check usernames for profanity when a player connects to the server. If a profane username is detected, the resource will take appropriate action to prevent the player from joining the server. The player will be notified that their username contains profanity and will be prompted to change it before they can join the server.
